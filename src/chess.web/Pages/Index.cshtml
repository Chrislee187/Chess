    <p>
        Welcome to the home-page of my chess "web-site".
    </p>
    <p>
        Although I can, have and do play chess on occasion I'm currently not an "active" player. That said, chess is an excellent, existing "domain" to use as a sandbox for experimenting with such things as; coding techniques, libraries, tools, UI frameworks, practices, processes, testing, integration and deployment mechanisms, architecture and design approaches and pretty much everything that goes along with the full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle" target="_blank">SDLC</a> of a product.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many resources out there for learning new technologies, frameworks etc. but most examples are fairly trivial and in my experience you will find something not covered by the online tutorial or even documentation, pretty quickly when you go to implement something in a production system.
    </p>
    <p>
        So these chess "tools" exists as something which has both large and complex enough codebase, that goes similar development pipelines to produce similar problems to those found in the work-place.
    </p>

    <p>
        The core of this suite is a chess "engine". This "engine" can;
        <ul>
            <li>
                maintain the state of a chess board
            </li>
            <li>
                show all the valid moves for the current board state
            </li>
            <li>
                determine whether a king is in check or has been checkmate
            </li>
            <li>
                supports both simple co-ordinate based input such as "d2d4" as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)" target="_blank">Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN)</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Using this engine I have developed some other tools including;
        <ul>
            <li>
                a simple webapi that uses a text based serialised representation of a board to transfer the state simply over the web that can be used to generate valid movelists for the board. <a href="http://chess-web-api.azurewebsites.net/swagger" target="_blank">See the swagger UI for it here</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                A very simple web-page using handlebars and a little jQuery to use the above web-api allow a game of chess to be played on between two human players.<a href="https://chess-web-api.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">See it here</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                PGN Parsing tools. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation" target="_blank">PGN</a> is a standard format/notation used to encode chess games. These currently include.
                <ul>
                    <li>A PgnReader to read PGN text files and parse in to .NET objects
                    </li>
                    <li>A simple web-page using the Razor Pages patterns to allow conversion of PGN text to a JSON compatible format.
                    </li>
                    <li>A command line PGN to JSON tool for batch conversion needs.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Other tools/utilities and ideas in various stages of thought/development include;
        <ul>
            <li>
                PGN command line tools to sort/filter/search PGN files
            </li>
            <li>
                Chess Game Library that PGN files can be imported in to for further processing.
            </li>
            <li>Chess players, using the available move information generated by the engine it will be easy to make some simple chess players.
            </li>
            <li>Tournaments between the "AI" players
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
