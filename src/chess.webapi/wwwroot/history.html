                More refinement around check detection routines, faster to not have to really on path regeneration, and
                checking which pieces can attack the king but rather, using a simple mask system, checks all possible
                squares that could attack the king for pieces that have moves that could attack from that square./li>

                More fixed for edge cases (i.e. when enpassant causes check) and some huge performance improvements
                to board parsing due to parallising some of the board generation and using a much more efficient
                check detection algorithm.
