            More refinement around check detection routines, custom mechanisms for "does a move cause check"
            and "does a move leave me in check" implemented as the later of those two is much slower to work out
            than the former

            More fixed for edge cases (i.e. when enpassant causes check) and some huge performance improvements
            to board parsing due to parallising some of the board generation and using a much more efficient
            check detection algorithm.
